      <description>Join us for a great short course demonstrating latest approaches, methods and workflows in hydrology and data analyses related to R. See below for the course&amp;rsquo;s description.
Wondering why or how to use R in hydrology? Youâ€™re in the right place! In this short course, you will learn how R is applied in a range of hydrological research settings from a number of guest lecturers.
Topics for 2018 include: - Recent R updates and packages - Accessing hydrological data using web APIs, with a demo of the rnrfa package - Reading and visualising large-scale gridded data (netCDF) - Processing, modelling and visualising hydrological data in R (tidyverse) - Hydrological modelling (airGR) and teaching modelling (airGRteaching) - An introduction to the smires and lfstat (low flow statistics) packages</description>

      <description>Being selected for a spot on the Erasmus Mundus Master&amp;rsquo;s Course &amp;ldquo;International Master&amp;rsquo;s in Applied Ecology&amp;rdquo; in 2013 was a great privilege and provided once-in-a-lifetime experiences and outstanding education. It was a great honor to be invited back to the graduation ceremony in 2016, one year after I completed the program, to share these experiences - as well as some insight on the path I chose after - to graduating and newly enrolling students during the Farewell Congress in Poitiers.</description>

      <description>This presentation featured work on partitioning atmospheric water fluxes from the subcanopy of a forested wetland in the Boreal Plain and discussed initial results on processes in the plant-soil continuum that reduce water losses under dry conditions.</description>
