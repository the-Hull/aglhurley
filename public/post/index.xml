      <description>Welcome! Happy to see you here. Blog posts on my website will hopefully not just be a brain dump reminding me of my ventures at some point in the future, but also spur your thoughts, help you solve a problem, or maybe get you interested in exchanging ideas. In any case, I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to creating some content on ecological and hydrological topics as well as some data science and visualization approaches.</description>
