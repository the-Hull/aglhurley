## What?

In this session [check out the details here](/talk/2018-egu-rhydro) you have the opportunity to see some great people and myself showcase the power of `R` in hydrology - that is, recent packages, models and approaches. Recent developments around the `R` user and developer base (e.g. **R-Ladies**) will also be discussed. This is the second installment of the short course (started by [Berry Boessenkool](https://github.com/brry)), which we hope will turn into a longer running series at the EGU AGMs.


## Why?

`R` is an exceptionally useful programming language for data science, modelling and producing (interactive) content. It's increasingly growing in popularity - from both employee and employer perspective (see [this infographic](http://blog.datacamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/R-vs-Python-216-2.png)) - due to its flexibility and open source nature. Academia has caught on, and `R` is now becoming more and more part of our day-to-day work*flows*. In short: don't miss out on 1.5 hours of **hydrology** and `R` fun!

## When and where?

On Wednesday, 11 April. From **10:30** to **12:00** in **Room -2.16**.
