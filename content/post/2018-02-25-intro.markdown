# Welcome!

Happy to see you here. Blog posts on my website will hopefully not just be a brain dump reminding me of my ventures at some point in the future, but also spur your thoughts, help you solve a problem, or maybe get you interested in exchanging ideas. In any case, I'm looking forward to creating some content on ecological and hydrological topics as well as some data science and visualization approaches.

So long and watch this space.
