<p>What a fun week at EGU2018 that was. Unfortunately, due to our time constraints and the many facets of <code>R</code>, I had to cut down on my content delivery for the actual presentation. But fear not:</p>
<p><a href="/files/ext_rmd/egu_rhydro_sc/presentation/01_rHydro_AGLHurley_proc-mod-viz"><strong>the entire tutorial (directorâ€™s cut) is right here,</strong></a> and you can find the raw document <a href="https://github.com/the-Hull/aglhurley/blob/master/static/files/ext_rmd/egu_rhydro_sc/presentation/01_rHydro_AGLHurley_proc-mod-viz.Rmd">here</a>.</p>
<div id="rstats-topics-that-are-covered-include" class="section level1">
<h1>rstats topics that are covered include:</h1>
<ul>
<li>intro to the #tidyverse (piping, mapping, nesting)</li>
<li>data handling</li>
<li>statistcal modelling (parameter estimation and model selection)</li>
<li>a tiny bit of spatial methods</li>
</ul>
<p>EGU2018 was immensely fun and stimulating, and the short course was a great success (especially working with the convener team and receiving immediate feedback):</p>
