<p>EGU2018 was immensely fun and stimulating, and the short course was a great success (especially working with the convener team and receiving immediate feedback)!</p>

<p>Due to our time constraints and the many facets of <code>R</code>, I had to cut down on my content delivery for the actual presentation. But fear not!</p>
<p><a href="/files/ext_rmd/egu_rhydro_sc/presentation/01_rHydro_AGLHurley_proc-mod-viz"><strong>The entire tutorial document is right here.</strong></a>.</p>
<p>You can find the raw document <a href="https://github.com/the-Hull/aglhurley/blob/master/static/files/ext_rmd/egu_rhydro_sc/presentation/01_rHydro_AGLHurley_proc-mod-viz.Rmd">here</a>.</p>
<p>As always, feel free to contact me with any questions, advice or feedback.</p>
<p>See you next time, at EGU2019!</p>
