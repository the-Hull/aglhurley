Due to our time constraints and the many facets of `R`, I had to cut down on my content delivery for the actual presentation. But fear not: 

[**the entire tutorial is right here,**](/files/ext_rmd/egu_rhydro_sc/presentation/01_rHydro_AGLHurley_proc-mod-viz) and you can find the raw document [here](https://github.com/the-Hull/aglhurley/blob/master/static/files/ext_rmd/egu_rhydro_sc/presentation/01_rHydro_AGLHurley_proc-mod-viz.Rmd).


EGU2018 was immensely fun and stimulating, and the short course was a great success (especially working with the convener team and receiving immediate feedback):

Thanks again to everybody that was involved or came along.

As always, feel free to contact me with any questions, advice or feedback.

See you at EGU2019!
