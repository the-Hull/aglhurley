<div id="what" class="section level2">
<h2>What?</h2>
<p>In this session you have the opportunity to see some great people and myself showcase the power of <code>R</code> in hydrology - that is, recent packages, models and approaches. Recent developments around the <code>R</code> user and developer base (e.g. <strong>R-Ladies</strong>) will also be discussed. This is the second installment of the short course (started by <a href="https://github.com/brry">Berry Boessenkool</a>), which we hope will turn into a longer running series at the EGU AGMs.</p>

<div id="why" class="section level2">
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p><code>R</code> is an exceptionally useful programming language for data science, modelling and producing (interactive) content. It’s increasingly growing in popularity - from both employee and employer perspective (see <a href="http://blog.datacamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/R-vs-Python-216-2.png">this infographic</a>) - due to its flexibility and open source nature. Academia has caught on, and <code>R</code> is now becoming more and more part of our day-to-day work<em>flows</em>. In short: don’t miss out on 1.5 hours of <strong>hydrology</strong> and <code>R</code> fun!</p>
