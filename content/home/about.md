# Biography

In general, my aim is to involve myself in innovative, collaborative and inter-disciplinary research in environmental sciences and applied ecology, enabling evidence-based decision-making. My research foci lie in  **boreal ecohydrology** (wetland-forest interactions), (urban) **tree-growth dynamics** and **plant ecophysiology**. I continuously dedicate myself to the generation of data, (software) tools and rigorous analyses in a transparent, accessible and reproducible manner.

In my current position at the [GFZ](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/home/), I am assessing **tree growth dynamics and long-term ecophysiological adaptations in urban(izing) settings across Berlin** and the wider North-East of Germany. This work is done in collaboration with the UFZ Leipzig under the umbrella of [HI-CAM (Helmholtz Initiative for Climate Adaptation and Mitigation)](https://www.helmholtz-klima.de/) in the Project Cluster *Urban Systems*.
