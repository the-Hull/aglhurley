# Biography

## Alex, who?

I am an early-career researcher at the [University of Birmingham](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk) under [Dr Nick Kettridge](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gees/kettridge-nick.aspx) and [Prof Stefan Krause](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gees/krause-stefan.aspx). I mostly spend my days working toward the completion of my **PhD**, but I sometimes find enough time at my disposal to dive into other subjects, fields and activities. Studying environmental issues allowed me to explore some great places and meet interesting people from a variety of fields and backgrounds - working in collaboratively is always a great joy!

## Science, what?

Science, I believe somewhat romantically and idealistically, is a truly altruistic endeavor, where we strive to  understand what's around us - for the benefit of our (and hopefully fellow) species. Sharing and communicating new insights is therefore vital. Base that on collaborative, reproducible and transparent research conduct, and that's what I want to be part of.

In the future, I wish to be engaged in innovative, collaborative and inter-disciplinary research in the fields of ecohydrology and applied ecology, ultimately allowing evidence-based decision-making.
