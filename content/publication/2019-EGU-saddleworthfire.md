abstract = "The  large-scale,  high-severity  Saddleworth  wildfire  burned  over  1000  hectares  of  UK  moorland  surroundingkey water supply reservoirs in June and July 2018 and instigated a ‘major national incident’. The burned region of  moorland  is  situated  in  the  heart  of  a  formerly  industrialised  region  of  the  UK  that  has  been  exposed  to high atmospheric deposition of contaminants such as heavy metals. Such wildfires and the concurrent drought experienced in the region during the summer of 2018 are projected to increase in frequency under future climate change, posing unknown risks to UK industry and public health due to the importance of these upland areas as a msource of drinking water. Utilizing the Saddleworth wildfire, we characterise down-stream moorland water quality through recurrent post-fire rainfall events in response to the compound impacts of extensive, severe wildfire and extreme drought conditions. Water  quality  (EC,  DO,  DOC,  pH,  turbidity,  DOM  characterisation)  was  measured  semi-continuously  in-situ  within  a  small  upland  headwater  catchment  entirely  burned  by  the  Saddleworth  wildfire.  Measurements were performed for a period of five months from the time of active fire and prior to any post-fire rainfall event. In  addition,  storm  sample  measurements  were  captured  at  1-hr  intervals  during  the  first  and  second  post-firestorm  events,  and  the  first  high  turbidity  autumn  post-fire  storm  event.  Storm  samples  were  measured  for nitrate,  phosphate,  ammonium,  DOC,  and  a  suite  of  metals  through  ICP-MS  (notably  lead).  Catchment  scale measurements were complemented with i) distributed in-situ measures of heavy metal concentrations through the catchment with pXRF, ii) laboratory based measures of ash leaching on samples collected prior to rainfall, and iii) semi-continuous measures of catchment water table positions and gully stage. Concentrations  of  lead  within  the  ash  were  up  to  4500  ppm,  respectively,  higher  than  any  concentrations observed previously within nearby unburned moorlands. This suggests that the combustion of peat and organic soils acts to concentrate atmospherically derived contaminants that have accumulated within upland organic soils. However, high metal concentrations in ash did not lead to acute stream water contamination. The first post-fire storm event, an intense 30 mm precipitation event, induced severe pH reductions from 6.4 to 3.9, and the highest increases in stream EC and DOC, reaching a maximum of 840 μS cm-1 and 47 mg/L respectively. These were accompanied by in-stream lead concentration peaking at 0.76 ppb. During the first high turbidity autumn storm event, peak lead concentrations increased to 4.6 ppb. These peak concentrations are within previously observed limits of unburned moorland catchments. This is likely due to any contaminants being strongly bound within the ash deposits, with levels of dissolution of metal contaminants being equivalent to a diverse range of comparatively uncontaminated heathland and forestland ecosystems. However, despite the low severity of the immediate waterquality response to fire through dissolution of contaminants, concentrated heavy metals within the catchment may provide a potential chronic impact on catchment water quality if subsequently transported through leaching or sediment erosional processes."
