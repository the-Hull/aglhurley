This poster presentation featured work on the dynamic nature of connectivity and resulting runoff patterns from aspen-forested headwater catchments in sub-humid, low-relief Boreal Plains landscapes.
Heterogeneous storage distribution in catchments, with lowest storage represented by forested wetlands with shallow, hydric soils, controls the magnitude and frequency of runoff.
