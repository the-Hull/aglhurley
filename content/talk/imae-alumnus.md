Being selected for a spot on the Erasmus Mundus Master's Course "International Master's in Applied Ecology" in 2013 was a great privilege and provided once-in-a-lifetime experiences and outstanding education. It was a great honor to be invited back to the graduation ceremony in 2016, one year after I completed the program, to share these experiences - as well as some insight on the path I chose after - to graduating and newly enrolling students during the *Farewell Congress* in Poitiers.
