Join us for a great short course demonstrating latest approaches, methods and workflows in hydrology and data analyses related to R. See below for the course's description.

---

Wondering why or how to use R in hydrology? Youâ€™re in the right place! In this short course, you will learn how R is applied in a range of hydrological research settings from a number of guest lecturers. 

Topics for 2018 include:
- Recent R updates and packages 
- Accessing hydrological data using web APIs, with a demo of the rnrfa package 
- Reading and visualising large-scale gridded data (netCDF)
- Processing, modelling and visualising hydrological data in R (tidyverse)
- Hydrological modelling (airGR) and teaching modelling (airGRteaching) 
- An introduction to the smires and lfstat (low flow statistics) packages 

This session is aimed at researchers who are interested in hearing more about R as well as those who are advanced R programmers wanting to discuss recent developments in an open environment. 

This session is organised in cooperation with the Young Hydrologic Society (YHS; https://younghs.com/)
