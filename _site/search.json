    "section": "",
    "text": "A key ecophysiological measurement is the flow of water (or sap) along the tree’s water-transport system, which is an essential process for maintaining the hydraulic connection within the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum. The thermal dissipation method (TDM) is widespread in the scientific community for measuring sap flow and has provided novel insights into water use and its environmental sensitivity, from the tree- to the forest-stand level. Yet, methodological approaches to determine sap flux density (SFD) from raw TDM measurements remain case-specific, introducing uncertainties and hampering data syntheses and meta-analyses.\nHere, we introduce the r package TREX (TRee sap flow EXtractor), incorporating a wide range of sap flow data-processing procedures to quantify SFD from raw TDM measurements. TREX provides functions for (a) importing and assimilating raw measurements, (b) data quality control and filtering and (c) calculating standardized SFD outputs and their associated uncertainties according to different data-processing methods.\nA case study using a Norway spruce tree illustrates TREX’s functionalities, featuring interactive data curation and generating outputs in a reproducible and transparent way. The calculations of SFD in TREX can, for instance, use the original TDM calibration coefficients, user-supplied calibration parameters or calibration data from a recently compiled database of 22 studies and 37 species. Moreover, the package includes an automatic procedure for quantifying the sensitivity and uncertainty of the obtained results to user-defined assumptions and parameter values, by means of a state-of-the-art global sensitivity analysis.\nTime series of plant ecophysiological measurements are becoming increasingly available and enhance our understanding of climate change impacts on tree functioning. TREX allows for establishing a baseline for data processing of TDM measurements and supports comparability between case studies, facilitating robust, transparent and reproducible large-scale syntheses of sap flow patterns. Moreover, TREX facilitates the simultaneous application of multiple common data-processing approaches to convert raw data to physiological relevant quantities. This allows for robust quantification of the impact (i.e. sensitivity and uncertainty) of user-specific choices and methodological assumptions, which is necessary for process understanding and policy making."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Dendroclimatic reconstructions, which are a well-known tool for extending records of climatic variability, have recently been expanded by using wood anatomical parameters. However, the relationships between wood cellular structures and large-scale climatic patterns, such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), are still not completely understood, hindering the potential for wood anatomy as a paleoclimatic proxy. To better understand the teleconnection between regional and local climate processes in the western United States, our main objective was to assess the value of these emerging tree-ring parameters for reconstructing climate dynamics. Using Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy, we measured cell lumen diameter and cell wall thickness (CWT) for the period 1966 to 2015 in five Douglas-firs [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] from two sites in eastern Arizona (United States). Dendroclimatic analysis was performed using chronologies developed for 10 equally distributed sectors of the ring and daily climatic records to identify the strongest climatic signal for each sector. We found that lumen diameter in the first ring sector was sensitive to previous fall–winter temperature (September 25th to January 23rd), while a precipitation signal (October 27th to February 13th) persisted for the entire first half of the ring. The lack of synchronous patterns between trees for CWT prevented conducting meaningful climate-response analysis for that anatomical parameter. Time series of lumen diameter showed an anti-phase relationship with the Southern Oscillation Index (a proxy for ENSO) at 10 to 14year periodicity and particularly in 1980–2005, suggesting that chronologies of wood anatomical parameters respond to multidecadal variability of regional climatic modes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of cell structural characteristics of southwestern United States conifers for reconstructing past climatic variability, while also improving our understanding of how large-scale ocean–atmosphere interactions impact local hydroclimatic patterns."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Peatlands are defined by their accumulated organic matter, providing valuable natural services such as storing carbon, and regulating climate, water quality and runoff. Such capability may be reduced when peatlands are impacted by extreme wildfires and droughts. We studied impacts of a severe wildfire and drought on stream water quality in a peatland catchment in the UK, within a region that may be more frequently impacted by these events in the future due to changing climate. This peatland also stores pollutants (namely metals emitted and retained during the industrial revolution), further enhancing risks to drinking water quality. We determined how the wildfire affected instream chemistry post-fire, and how nutrients and metals moved through the catchment. We found that levels of nutrients in the stream flow increased immediately after the wildfire, followed by a decrease with time. However, the levels of metals increased during the following autumn and spring. This suggests that metals were released later and came from different parts of the catchment compared to the nutrients. Our results show that following the fire, the way water flowed through the catchment played an important role in how substances were transported. The impacts on water quality were most pronounced in the first months post-wildfire and seemed to be short-lived."

    "text": "Sapwood characteristics, such as sapwood area as well as thermal and hydraulic conductivity, are linked to species-specific hydraulic function and resource allocation to water transport tissues (xylem). These characteristics are often unknown and thus a major source of uncertainty in sap flow data processing and transpiration estimates because bulk rather than species-specific values are usually applied. Here, we analyzed the sapwood characteristics of fifteen common tree species in eastern North America from different taxonomic (i.e., angiosperms and gymnosperms) and xylem porosity groups (i.e., tracheid-bearing, diffuse- or ring-porous species) and we assessed how uncertainties in sapwood characteristics involved in sap flow calculations are propagated in tree water use estimates. We quantified their sapwood area changes with stem diameter (allometric scaling) and thermal conductivity. We combined these measurements with species-specific values of wood density and hydraulic conductivity found in the literature and assessed the role of wood anatomy in orchestrating their covariation. Using an example sap flow dataset from tree species with different xylem porosity, we assessed the sensitivity of tree water use estimates to sapwood characteristics and their interactions. Angiosperms (ring- and diffuse-porous species), with specialized vessels for water transport, showed a steeper relationship (scaling) between tree stem diameter and sapwood area in comparison to gymnosperms (tracheid-bearing species). Gymnosperms (angiosperms) were characterized by lower (higher) wood density and higher (lower) sapwood moisture content, resulting in non-significant differences in sapwood thermal conductivity between taxonomic and xylem porosity groups. Clustering of species sapwood characteristics based on taxonomic or xylem porosity groups and constraining these parameters could facilitate more accurate sap flow calculations and tree water use estimates. When combined with an increasing number of sap flow observations, these findings should improve tree- and landscape-level transpiration estimates, leading to more robust partitioning of terrestrial water fluxes."

The package is open-source, and based on the R programming language. A key functionality of datacleanr is the “reproducible recipe”—a translation of all interactive actions into R code, which can be integrated into existing analyses pipelines. This enables researchers experienced with script-based workflows to utilize the strengths of interactive processing without sacrificing their usual work style or functionalities from other (R) packages. We demonstrate the package’s utility by addressing two common issues during data analyses, namely 1) identifying problematic structures and artefacts in hierarchically nested data, and 2) preventing excessive loss of data from ‘coarse,’ code-based filtering of time series.

    "title": "RAPTOR: Row and position tracheid organizer in R",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Mechanistic understanding of tree-ring formation and its modelling requires a cellular-based and spatially organized characterization of a tree ring, moving from whole rings, to intra-annual growth zones and individual cells. A tracheidogram is a radial profile of conifer anatomical features, such as lumen area and cell wall thickness, of sequentially- and positionally-ranked tracheids. However, its construction is tedious and time-consuming since image-analysis-based measurements do not recognize the position of cells within a radial file, and present-day tracheidograms must be constructed manually. Here we present the R-package RAPTOR that complements tracheid anatomical data obtained from quantitative wood anatomy software (e.g., ROXAS, WinCELL, ImageJ), with the specific positional information necessary for the automated construction of tracheidograms. The package includes functions to read and visualize tracheid anatomical data, and uses local search algorithms to ascribe a ranked position to each tracheid in identified radial files. The package also provides functions to ensure that tracheids are adequately aligned for identifying the first tracheid in each radial file, and obtaining the correct ranking of tracheids along each radial file. Additional functions allow automating the analyses for multiple samples and rings (batch mode) and exporting data and plots for quality control. RAPTOR allows tracheidogram users to take advantage of the latest generation of cell anatomical measuring systems. With this R-package we aim to facilitate the construction of more robust and versatile tracheidograms for the benefit of the research community."

    "title": "Assessing urban-heating impact on street tree growth in Berlin with open inventory and environmental data",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Excess heat (i.e., Urban Heat Island; UHI) and other urban conditions affect tree physiology with outcomes from enhanced growth to mortality. Resilient urban forests in the face of climate change require species-specific understanding of growth responses. However, previous studies assessing growth dynamics were primarily based on remote sensing of communities rather than individuals, or relied on labor-intensive methods that can limit the spatial coverage necessary to account for highly variable urban growing conditions. Here, we analyze growth dynamics of common urban street tree species over time and across space for Berlin (Germany) combining dendroecological (temporal) and inventory assessments (spatial). First, we show annual increments increased across the 20th century for early (i.e., young) growth. Second, we use an approach relying on open inventory data to identify growth potential in relation to excess heat while accounting for age, potential management effects, and the urban fabric (i.e., planting area; building density, height; available soil nutrients) with generalized additive models for the ten most abundant species. Our analyses showed that younger trees may benefit from increased temperatures, while older individuals feature lower growth at greater UHI magnitudes. Furthermore, planting area as well as building density modulate growth responses to temperature. Lastly, we discuss management implications in the context of climate change mitigation, considering that younger trees are predominantly located at UHI “hot spots” and will undergo the observed age-dependent shift in temperature-growth sensitivity. By relying on increasingly available open data, our approach here is or will be transferable to other urban regions."

    "title": "Site matters-Canopy conductance regulation in mature temperate trees diverges at two sites with contrasting soil water availability",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Tree-specific canopy conductance (Gc) and its adjustment play a critical role in mitigating excess water loss in changing environmental conditions. However, the change of Gc sensitivity to environmental conditions due to drought remains unclear for European tree species. Here we quantified the environmental operational space of Gc, i.e., the water supply (soil moisture, tree water deficit) and demand conditions (vapor pressure deficit) under which Gc ≥ 50% is possible (Gc50OS), at two sites with different soil water availability for three common European tree species. We collected sap flow and dendrometer measurements for co-occurring Pinus sylvestris, Fagus sylvatica and Quercus petraea growing under different soil hydrological conditions (drier/wetter). These measurements were combined with meteorological variables and soil moisture conditions in five depths. Dendrometer measurements were used to confirm soil water availability patterns. For all analyses, the contrasting soil hydrology between sites was the main driver of Gc response. At the drier sites, F. sylvatica and P. sylvestris reduced their water consumption in response to decreasing soil water supply earlier in the growing season than Q. petraea. However, our analysis on the Gc50OS revealed that at the drier sites, F. sylvatica and Q. petraea reduced the extent of their Gc50OS to a higher degree than P. sylvestris. This indicates a higher level of Gc50OS adjustment to the drier site conditions for the two broadleaved species. These differences were more pronounced when using the dendrometer-derived tree internal water status as proxy for tree water supply. Our results provide preliminary evidence for diverging short-term Gc responses when temperate trees are exposed to prolonged reduction in water availability. These findings suggest that Gc50OS can help to constrain species-specific predictions of water use by mature trees, especially when combined with high-resolution water potential measurements."

    "title": "Legacy effects in radial tree growth are rarely significant after accounting for biological memory",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Drought legacies in radial tree growth are an important feature of variability in biomass accumulation and are widely used to characterize forest resilience to climate change. Defined as a deviation from normal growth, the statistical significance of legacy effects depends on the definition of “normal”—expected growth under average conditions—which has not received sufficient scrutiny.\nWe re-examined legacy effect analyses using the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) and then produced synthetic tree-ring data to disentangle four key variables influencing the magnitude of legacy effects. We hypothesized that legacy effects (i) are mainly influenced by the auto-correlation of the radial growth time series (phi), (ii) depend on climate-growth cross-correlation (rho), (iii) are directly proportional to the inherent variability of the growth time series (standard deviation, SD), and (iv) scale with the chosen extreme event threshold.\nUsing a data simulation approach, we were able to reproduce observed lag patterns, demonstrating that legacy effects are a direct outcome of ubiquitous biological memory. We found that stronger legacy effects for conifers compared to angiosperms is a consequence of their higher auto-correlation, and that the detectability of legacy effects following rare drought events at individual sites is compromised by strong background stochasticity.\nSynthesis. We propose two pathways forward to improve the assessment and interpretation of legacy effects: First, we highlight the need to account for auto-correlated residuals of climate-growth regression models a posteriori, thereby retrospectively adjusting expectations for “normal” growth variability. Alternatively, we recommend including lagged climate variables in regression models a priori. By doing so, the magnitude of detected legacy effects is greatly reduced and biological memory is directly attributed to antecedent climatic drivers. We argue that future analyses should focus on understanding the functional reasons for how and why key statistical parameters describing this biological memory differ across species and sites. These two pathways should also stimulate improved process-based representation of vegetation carbon dynamics in mechanistic models."
